Vault uses [policies](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/policies.html) to govern the behavior of clients and instrument Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) by specifying access privileges (authorization).

When you first initialize Vault, the root policy gets created by default. This root policy is a special policy that gives superuser access to everything in Vault. Therefore, it is recommended that a token with root policy is used for just enough initial setup or in emergencies. As a best practice, use tokens with an appropriate set of policies based on your role in the organization.
